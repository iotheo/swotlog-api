# Prerequisites

* Install [pg-native](https://github.com/brianc/node-pg-native#install)
* Install [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/).<br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is highly discouraged to mix package managers between projects, so we opt in using yarn, because<br/> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;it's safer -_does not_ update lock.json when `yarn install`- and is relatively faster than npm.

# Start project
`yarn start`
